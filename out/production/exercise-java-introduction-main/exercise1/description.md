# Scanner

Look at the code in `Application.java` and try the following:
- Run the code via IntelliJ
- Run the code via the command-line

Review the construction with the class `Scanner`:
- A `Scanner` is a built-in class that allows reading from console
- With the line `java.util.Scanner scanner = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);` a new `Scanner` is defined that can then be used to read-in input
- Every time `scanner.nextLine();` is called the program stops until the user gives his input via the console

You can copy this construction to the next exercises whenever it is necessary to read input.
